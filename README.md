# Predicting-Plant-Growth-Stages-with-Environmental-and-Management-Data-Using-Power-BI
## Project Overview    
  This project focuses on using Power BI to analyse environmental and management data, 
such as temperature, humidity, irrigation, and fertilization schedules, to predict plant growth 
stages. The goal is to provide actionable insights that optimize resource use, improve 
decision-making, and enhance crop productivity, supporting sustainable farming practices.
